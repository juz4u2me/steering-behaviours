This project is an attempt to implement Craig Reynolds's steering behaviours using Javascript (React and NodeJS). The following behaviours are implemented to the best of my knowledge:
1. Seek
2. ~~Flee~~ & Arrival
3. ~~Wander~~
4. ~~Pursuit & Evade~~
5. Collision Avoidance
6. ~~Path Following~~
7. ~~Leader Following~~
8. ~~Queuing~~
